## Development

### Setting Up the Extension

1. **Manifest File**: The `manifest.json` file defines the extension's metadata, permissions, and background scripts. This setup is crucial for defining the extensionâ€™s behavior and permissions.

2. **Popup Design**: Created using HTML and CSS to ensure a clean and intuitive user interface. The popup includes input fields for language selection and a button for triggering translations.

3. **JavaScript Implementation**: Developed scripts to handle translation requests. This involves capturing user input, sending requests to the translation API, and injecting the translated content into the current web page.

4. **API Integration**: Integrated with a translation API to provide accurate translations. This required handling API requests, parsing responses, and managing error cases.

### Challenges

- **API Rate Limits**: Dealt with restrictions imposed by translation APIs, which required implementing efficient request handling and caching mechanisms.
- **Cross-Origin Requests**: Managed permissions and configurations to handle cross-origin requests when injecting translated content.
- **UI/UX Design**: Ensured the popup interface was responsive and user-friendly across different screen sizes and resolutions.

## Future Improvements

- **Support for More Languages**: Expand the number of supported languages and translation services.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling for API failures and network issues.
- **User Preferences**: Implement a feature to save user preferences for language settings.
